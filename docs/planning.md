# Vinyl Audio Block

## Step One

Replicate the functionality of the audio block. Using the `audio` element.

## Step Two

Add a custom UI that replicates the features of the standard `audio` element.

## Step Three

Incrementally add features to expand the functionality.

### Ideas

- Remember playhead position. I've noticed many players start back at the beginning when you navigate back to the webpage.
- Speed control. Globally remember last setting, probably just through `localStorage`.
- Visualization. Start super simple, just the audio graph in 2D.
- Playlist. Grouping audio files together, which can be played sequentially.
- Styling. Offer some block customizations, though also make sure custom CSS can be used to override the existing styling.
- Localization. Make it easily to translate. Make it work in different origination, right -> left, or top -> bottom.
